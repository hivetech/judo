description: |
  Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
  features have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting,
  command line history, on-line help, filename completion, block
  operations, folding, Unicode support, etc.  This package contains a
  version of vim compiled with a rather standard set of features.  This
  package does not provide a GUI version of Vim.  See the other vim-*
  packages if you need more (or less).
